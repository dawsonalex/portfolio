Setting up a blog can be fun, especially if you're desiging and writing the site yourself. But I usually get put off from ever writing anything because I have ideas for posts when I'm away from laptop or PC, and writing notes on my phone is okay until I forget where I've put them, or forget about the notes entirely. This show how I've set up Netlify CMS with my Hugo site, so I can create drafts or full posts anywhere I have a web browser and internet connection.
